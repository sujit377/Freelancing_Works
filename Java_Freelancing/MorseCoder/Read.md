# Morses Climbs the Mountain of Communication
In May of 1844, Samuel F. B. Morse sent a message by telegraph from Washington to Baltimore, heralding the beginning of the age of electronic communication and thereby starting humanity upon the slippery slope that would eventually lead to Tinder. While Tinder users have two directions available to them to swipe to ("Yes, please!" and "Next, please!"), Samuel Morse only had the presence or absence of a single tone to work with, so his code consists of short and long variations of both.

## do two things:
1. Encode an input String into its Morse code representation. The international Morse code can be found 
	over here (we only care about letters and digits).
2. Decode an input String from Morse code back into natural language.
